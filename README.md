Tamer is a domesticated Kafka source connector.

It puts the user of this library in complete control of how data is ingested and what state is preserved (in a compacted Kafka topic).
As an example, it allows for a JDBC source to pull a window of data (e.g. 5 minutes), starting from some time in the past, as fast as possible.
At every "pull", the user can decide what to do next (e.g. should the window be increased/decreased? Should the pull slow down?).

Tamer currently supports 4 possible source types:
- any SQL data store Doobie can handle (e.g. Postgres, MySQL, etc)
- any cloud storage that is AWS S3 compatible
- OCI Object Storage
- any type of REST API, with AuthN, pagination and HATEOAS support

Some sensible defaults are provided out of the box but many customisations are possible.

## Usage

Add one of Tamer's modules as a dependency to your project:

```
// check the current version on Maven Central (or use the badge above)
libraryDependencies += "io.laserdisc" %% "tamer-db"                % version
libraryDependencies += "io.laserdisc" %% "tamer-oci-objectstorage" % version
libraryDependencies += "io.laserdisc" %% "tamer-rest"              % version
libraryDependencies += "io.laserdisc" %% "tamer-s3"                % version
```

See [here](example/src/main/scala/tamer/db/DatabaseSimple.scala) for a sample application that makes use of Tamer's Db module for ingesting data from a JDBC datasource.

## End to end testing

### Database module

Basic manual testing is available for the code in the example module `tamer.db.DatabaseSimple` (and/or `tamer.db.DatabaseGeneralized`).
This code covers getting data from a synthetic Postgres database.

Make sure you have docker installed before proceeding.

From the `db/local` folder launch `docker compose up` (you can enter `docker compose down` if you want to start from scratch). After that you should be able to access the Kafka gui from [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

Start the `runDatabaseSimple.sh` program which contains some example environment variables.
If Tamer works you should see messages appearing in the Kafka gui.

### S3 module

Basic manual testing is available for the code in the example module `tamer.s3.S3Simple`.
This code covers getting data from a synthetic S3 bucket.

Make sure you have docker installed before proceeding.

From the `s3/local` folder launch `docker compose up` (you can enter `docker compose down` if you want to start from scratch). After that you should be able to access the Kafka gui from [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

Start the `runS3Simple.sh` program which contains some example environment variables.
If Tamer works you should see messages appearing in the Kafka gui.
